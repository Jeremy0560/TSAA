Prerequisites:
Node.js
NPM

Setup:
Download the latest version.
Unpack it anywhere.
Open the path in cmd (click on the empty space to the right of the path on the top of the window).
Type "npm i" [stands for Node Package Manager Install], it will install all the needed node_modules for program to run smoothly.

Run the app(see below) and add "http://localhost:8082/" as a Browser Source.

To run:
Type "node index.js" it will start the program.
If you already added a browser source - click the "Refresh button" to connect to the local server.

To add sounds:
Move sound files to the "resources" folder. Rename them to according command, e.g.:
By default you have 2 sounds in resources folder called "smooth" and "unsmooth", typing "!smooth" in chat will play the sound.

To add randomised sounds: create a folder and name it as according command, e.g.:
By default you have "random" folder in resources folder, inside you have 3 sounds, typing "!random" in chat will play random sound from the folder.

Important note:
Sounds do not update while the program is running. You'll have to restart the app to update sounds. (You'll have to refresh the Browser source in your streaming app as well.)

P.S. Feel free to dm me, if you have any issues and/or ideas.
